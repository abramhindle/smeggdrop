* TODO of Smeggdrop
** Spamming
   - when flood-lined the bot should spam like no tomorrow
** Latency
   - Why does it take so long to respond?
** Security: Detect wipe-out
   - Detect if many procs are wiped out?
** Write out
   - Who should write out state?
** Multiple State Test
   - I dunno how multiple states and the ForkRing work
** Should Fork Ring be optional?
   - The fork ring could be an option
** Fix the problem of making the unforkable process
   - I could keep filling memory until the process could not fork no
     more. That'd effectively screw up the bot.
   - It needs to know when it should give up the ghost and dump cache
     etc.
** Error Messages
   - There needs to be better error messages on death
** HTTP Proxy
   - Not sure if we need this but an HTTP proxy might help
